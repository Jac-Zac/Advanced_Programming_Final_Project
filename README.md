- Fix paralelism

### How I visualize it:

```bash
./main test.pgm 5000 1000 && icat test.pgm
```

It should compute pixel 0, 0 and automatically copy that to the pixcel at -1 0 or something

Didn't use complex numbers so that I can then use them reuse the code for the vectorized version

Example code
